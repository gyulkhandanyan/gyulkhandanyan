I'm interested in cyber security and cloud technologies, and I'm passionate about exploring their intersection.
Currently, I'm actively preparing for the AZ-104 certification, focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in Azure administration.
I'm eager to collaborate with organisations or individuals involved in exciting cloud and cybersecurity projects. I'm always seeking opportunities to contribute and learn from like-minded professionals.
You can reach me at e.gyulkhandanyan@gmail.com. I'm open to discussions, collaborations, and networking opportunities in the fields of cloud and cybersecurity.
Looking forward to connecting and exploring new possibilities together!
